I spend a lot of time around my programmer friends and they encouraged me to increase my interest in IT.
I took a course and during my studying I have learned basics of IT inclouding front end,Linux, git, sql.
Later i mastered my skills in Java Backend such as Collections, Lambdas & Stream , IO , Multithreading, Spring.
Sometimes I struggled to understand some topics but this never discouraged me and I would do the research
until i found the answer I was looking for.
My hard work has been noticed, I started to be considered the strongest student and eventually became the leader of my group.
Moreover I was helping one of my classmates to catch up with the studying by
giving him lessons explaining the current material.
My biggest strenght is determination and motivation to work hard, constantly improve myself and use every
given opportunity to become a significant part of your company. 
In the future I see myself using my experience to help young programmers, such as myself right now, to learn more and more.
